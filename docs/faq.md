## How does Syncwise work?

Syncwise utilizes a browser extension to enhance your bookmark management process. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Extension Interaction**: The Syncwise browser extension scrolls through the pages on your social media platforms.
2. **Bookmark Capture**: As it scrolls, the extension captures your bookmarks by parsing the HTML of the page.
3. **Synchronization**: The captured bookmarks are then synchronized to your Syncwise account on our website, where they can be organized and accessed easily.

This method ensures a seamless transfer of your saved content to Syncwise without any manual input.

## Will using Syncwise result in my social media accounts being blocked?

Absolutely not. Syncwise operates in a way that mimics natural user interaction:

- **User Simulation**: The extension simulates the scrolling action typical of a user browsing through their social media.
- **Content Parsing**: It uses JavaScript to parse only the visible page content, without performing any intrusive actions.

This approach ensures that Syncwise does not violate social media terms of service, keeping your accounts safe and secure while using our service.
