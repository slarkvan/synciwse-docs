# Synchronizing Bookmarks with Syncwise

Syncwise allows you to seamlessly integrate bookmarks from various social media platforms into one central location. This guide provides detailed instructions on how to synchronize your bookmarks using Syncwise.

## What is Bookmark Synchronization?

Bookmark synchronization is the process of aggregating bookmarks from different platforms and devices into a single Syncwise account. This enables you to access your saved content from any device, anywhere, ensuring that your digital resources are always at your fingertips.

## How to Sync Your Bookmarks

To synchronize your bookmarks with Syncwise, follow these streamlined steps:

1. **Configuration Verification**: Ensure you have successfully configured the Syncwise browser plugin as per the instructions in the [Installation and Setup Guide](installation-and-setup.md).

2. **Open Syncwise Panel**: Log in to a specific social media platform (ensure you are already logged in to this platform). For example, on Twitter, enable the `Display Syncwise's Panel on Twitter` switch to open the Syncwise panel on the right side of the webpage.

3. **Collect Bookmarks**: Click the `Collect` button in the Syncwise panel. The webpage will navigate to the bookmarks page. Scroll down continuously; all you need to do is wait until the panel indicates `All items collected, click the synchronize button to sync.` This message confirms that all bookmarks from the platform have been gathered.

4. **Start Synchronization**: Press the `Synchronize` button on the panel. Wait until you see the `Synchronization Successful` notification. Your bookmarks are now synchronized and available at [https://syncwise.xyz/console](https://syncwise.xyz/console).

## Managing Your Synchronized Bookmarks

After your bookmarks are synchronized, you can access them directly through the Syncwise dashboard. Currently, Syncwise supports intelligent search and custom tagging features. These functionalities allow you to efficiently organize and retrieve your bookmarks as needed.
